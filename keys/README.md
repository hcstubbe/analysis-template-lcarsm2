# Keys

Add the `keys.txt` file in this folder adding your keys (you can use `example_keys.txt` as template). Make sure you do not commit your `keys.txt` file (that is why `keys.txt` is added to the `.gitignore` file).

You get your keys upon first launching the study.
Copy your study keys to the `keys.txt` file like this:

```
Private study key: key-string
Public server key: key-string
```
